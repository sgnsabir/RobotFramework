# Robot Framework backbone project <br>
<p>This project can be used as a backbone of Robot Framework based automation project. I learned a lot during developing this project. If someone has basic knowledge of python and selenium they can easily cope up with Robotframework.
In this framework, I introduced page object model, so that frequent change of web applicaiton like ecommerce application can we easily maintain the framework.</p>
